## 🎮 Overview

IntelliWord is an advanced AI-powered word search game developed using Python and Pygame. Unlike traditional word search games, IntelliWord introduces four dynamic game modes and an intelligent AI opponent that competes against the player in real-time. The AI utilizes a directionally constrained DFS algorithm to find words with 100% accuracy, providing a challenging and engaging experience for players.

## 🧠 Game Modes

1. Grid Shuffle Mode  
   - Human vs AI  
   - After every word found, the grid is shuffled, increasing difficulty.  
   - Both human and AI play simultaneously.

2. Word Bomb Mode 
   - A randomly selected word carries a hidden bomb.  
   - The player must find the bomb word to defuse it within the time limit.

3. Word Chain Mode  
   - Players must find a sequence of related words in order.

4. Fog of War Mode 
   - The grid is partially hidden. Cells reveal only when nearby cells are discovered, adding exploration logic.
